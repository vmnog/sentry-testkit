Sentry testkit consists of a very simple and strait-forward API using the following functions:
* [extractException](/docs/api/extractException.md)
* [findReport](/docs/api/findReport.md)
* [getExceptionAt](/docs/api/getExceptionAt.md)
* [isExist](/docs/api/isExist.md)
* [reports](/docs/api/reports.md)
* [reset](/docs/api/reset.md)

### What About Nodejs?
**Of Course!**
`sentry-testkit` has full support in both `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/node` since they have the same API and lifecycle under the hood.

### Raven-Testkit
The good old legacy `raven-testkit` documentation can be found [here](../raven/LEGACY_API.md). It it still there to serve `Raven` which is the old legacy SDK of *Sentry* for JavaScript/Node.js platforms
